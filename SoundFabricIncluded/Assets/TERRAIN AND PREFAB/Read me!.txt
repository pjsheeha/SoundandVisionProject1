Import this whole folder and the terrain should work. Just put the prefab in the scene. 

I figured out how to put wind on my grass and foliage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QbpCZuGe7M 

There are a few hills but not enough to obsure the camera, just put a ridgid body on the player character and lock all directions of rotation. 

It is a large map, but you can concentrate it by making the fog barrier closer in on the map. 

feel free to add more trees and foliage. 

Each location is marked by a cube.
